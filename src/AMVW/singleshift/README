Polynomial Rootfinder ZAMVW
complex single shift code

The algorithm uses Francis's implicitly shifted QR algorithm to compute the
roots of a given complex polynomial via the Companion matrix. The available
unitary plus rank 1 structure is exploited. Thus the complexity of the algorithm
is in O(n²).

To compile the Fortran code it is necessary to set some parameters in the file
environment.

For the test of the special polynomials is the package MPFUN necessary, which 
is provided at http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/mpfun90.tar.gz by David H. Bailey;
see also http://www.netlib.org/mpfun/.

Please extract the files into a directory and run the makefile in the f90 directory. 
Then at the change the path MPDIR in environment.
