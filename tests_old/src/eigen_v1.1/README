The module eigensolve contains subroutines for solving the generalized
tridiagonal eigenvalue problem 
            det(T-x S)=0
where T is an irreducible tridiagonal matrix with real entries
and S is a nonsingular diagonal matrix with real entries.
More precisely, the subroutines are
                                                                                
 EIGEN:    recursive subroutine for computing the generalized eigenvalues
 ABERTH:   Aberth's iteration
 NEWTCORR: Newton correction
 VALIDATE: computation of inclusion radii for all the approximations
 POLY:     computation of det(T-x S)
 NORMALIZE: subroutine which transforms the generalized eigenvalue problem
          T-xS into normalized form T'-xS' where T' has unit off-diagonal
          entries
 Quadruple precision subroutines:
 QABERTH: It refines the approximations in quadruple precision
 QNEWTCORR:
 QNORMALIZE:

 CALLING LINE:
 CALL eigen(n,a,s,z,cond)
 n: size of the matrix
 a: diagonal elements of T
 s: diagonal elements of S
 z: complex vector with the approximations to the eigenvalues
 cond: real vector with the condition number estimates of the eigenvalues
